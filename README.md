## Introduction

In today's world, effective network design is crucial for seamless communication within organizations. This project aims to create a reliable network setup that connects two key departments: ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY. By following this guide, you will learn how to implement best practices in cabling, IP addressing, and network testing.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design a network that allows the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments to communicate efficiently. We will use Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the network and apply various networking concepts. This project will cover:

- **Connectivity**: Ensuring that both departments can communicate.
- **Cabling**: Using the right cables for different connections.
- **IP Addressing**: Planning and configuring IP addresses.
- **Testing**: Verifying that the network works as intended.

## Key Topics

This project covers several important topics in networking:

- Connectivity
- Connectivity Testing
- Crossover Cable
- IP Address Planning
- IP Addressing
- IP Configuration
- Ping
- Router Interface Configuration
- Straight-Through Cable
- Subnetting
- Traceroute
- Troubleshooting

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Cisco website. Once installed, you can open the project files available in this repository.

You can also check the [Releases](https://github.com/Zuctry/Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Simple-Network/releases) section for any updates or additional resources.

## Network Design

The network design involves several components:

1. **Devices**: Routers, switches, and end devices (computers, printers).
2. **Cabling**: Use appropriate cables for connections.
3. **IP Addressing**: Assign IP addresses to each device.

### Network Topology

We will use a star topology for this network. In a star topology, all devices connect to a central switch. This setup provides better performance and easier troubleshooting.

### Devices Used

- **Router**: Connects different networks.
- **Switch**: Connects devices within the same network.
- **End Devices**: Computers and printers for both departments.

## Cabling Best Practices

Using the right cables is essential for effective network performance. Here are some guidelines:

- **Straight-Through Cable**: Used to connect different devices, such as a switch to a router.
- **Crossover Cable**: Used to connect similar devices, such as switch to switch.

### Cable Specifications

- **Category 5e (Cat 5e)**: Suitable for most networks.
- **Category 6 (Cat 6)**: Offers better performance for high-speed networks.

## IP Addressing

Proper IP addressing is crucial for network communication. Here‚Äôs how to plan and configure IP addresses:

### IP Address Planning

1. **Subnetting**: Divide the network into smaller subnets for better management.
2. **Address Allocation**: Assign IP addresses based on the number of devices in each department.

### Example IP Address Scheme

- **ACCOUNTS Department**: 192.168.1.0/24
- **DELIVERY Department**: 192.168.2.0/24

### Configuring IP Addresses

To configure IP addresses on devices:

1. Access the device settings in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Navigate to the IP configuration section.
3. Enter the assigned IP address and subnet mask.

## Testing the Network

After setting up the network, it‚Äôs essential to test connectivity. Here are some common testing methods:

### Ping

Use the `ping` command to check if devices can communicate:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.2
```

### Traceroute

Use the `traceroute` command to identify the path packets take through the network:

```bash
traceroute 192.168.2.2
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, follow these steps:

1. **Check Connections**: Ensure all cables are connected properly.
2. **Verify IP Configuration**: Ensure all devices have the correct IP addresses.
3. **Use Diagnostic Tools**: Utilize tools like ping and traceroute to identify problems.
