# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Simple-Networking


Design a network in  Cisco Packet Tracer to connects ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following:
Each department should contain at least two PCs.
Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.


# 🖧 Cisco Packet Tracer Network Design Project

## 📘 Objective

Design a network in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to connect the **ACCOUNTS** and **DELIVERY** departments using appropriate devices, IP addressing, and connectivity.

---

## 🧩 Network Requirements

- 🖥️ Each department (**ACCOUNTS** and **DELIVERY**) must contain **at least two PCs**.
- 📶 Use an appropriate number of **switches** and **routers** to interconnect the devices.
- 🌐 IP addressing must be based on the **192.168.40.0/24** network.
  - Assign correct **IP addresses**, **subnet masks**, and **default gateways** to all interfaces.
- 🔌 Use **appropriate cables** to connect all devices (copper straight-through, crossover where necessary).
- ✅ Verify **end-to-end communication** between PCs in the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments using the `ping` command.

## 💻 Technologies Implemented

This project demonstrates key networking fundamentals using Cisco Packet Tracer and includes the following implementations:

- 🛠️ **Creating a Simple Network**  
  Designed a basic LAN topology using a **Router** and an **Access Layer Switch**.

- 🔌 **Correct Cabling of Network Devices**  
  Connected PCs, switches, and routers using appropriate cable types (straight-through and crossover).

- 🌐 **Connecting Two Networks via a Router**  
  Enabled communication between two different subnets using a **single router**.

- 🧮 **Subnetting and IP Addressing**  
  Applied custom subnetting on the `192.168.x.x/24` network to efficiently allocate IP ranges.

- 📟 **IP Configuration on Router Interfaces**  
  Assigned **IPv4 static IPs** to each interface of the router based on the subnet plan.

- 🖥️ **Static IP Assignment to End Devices**  
  Manually configured static IP addresses on host machines (PCs) within each subnet.

- ✅ **Testing and Verifying Communication**  
  Used `ping` and other diagnostic tools to validate network connectivity across all devices and departments.

> 📁 All configurations were completed in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, and results were verified through simulation mode and successful ping tests.
